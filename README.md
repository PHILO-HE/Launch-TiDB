This repository mainly includes the source code of Pd, TiKV and TiDB for building shared libraries.

# build prerequisite

1. build Rocksdb.

   run build_rocksdb.sh

2. install Golang (1.5+ version).

   https://golang.org/dl/

   Suppose ${GO_HOME} is the path where golang is installed. Please set ${GO_HOME}/bin/ in $PATH.
   If ${GO_HOME} is not under /usr/local/, please set $GOROOT: export GOROOT=${GO_HOME}.

3. install Rust. Only the nightly version is valid.

   https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/other-installers.html

# support SSM project

  To enable TiDB in SSM (https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/SSM.git), you should run build_shared_libs.sh to generate three files with .so suffix under lib/ directory in this project.

  After build is completed, you should put libpd.so, libtikv.so and libtidb.so into {SSM_HOME}/lib.
  The libtikv.so is dynamically linked to librocksdb.so.5.6. So you should also build rocksdb as build prerequisite section guides on each host where TiKV is deployed.

# run demo

  Run compile.sh to compile the java code and run start.sh to start tidb.

# deployment tips

1. unset http_proxy and https_proxy.

2. Options for PD, TiKV and TiDB.

   The client-urls option for pd must be a http address and a hostname is not valid.
   The addr option for tikv should be a ip address without starting with http.
   The pd option for tikv and the path option for tidb can be either a hostname or an ip address.
   In the cluster situation, the client-url option for pd and the addr option for tikv should not be 127.0.0.1.

   Here is an example.

   For Pd server, --name=pd --data-dir=pd --client-urls="http://192.168.150.104:2379" --peer-urls="http://192.168.150.104:2380" --log-file=pd.log

   For Tikv server, --pd="192.168.150.104:2379" --addr="192.168.150.109:20160"  --data-dir=tikv --log-file=tikv.log

   For Tidb server, --store=tikv --path="192.168.150.104:2379" --log-file=tidb.log
